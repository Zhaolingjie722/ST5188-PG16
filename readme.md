# Data Description

## In-the-Wild

(1) Source: A real-life deepfake speech dataset compiled by the Fraunhofer AISEC CST team.
The paper Does Audio Deepfake Detection Generalize? (Interspeech 2022) and the official website provide downloads.

(2) Structure: A total of 58 public figures, each with both real and fake audio; 20.8 hours of real audio, 17.2 hours of
fake audio, a total of about 38 hours.

All data is stored in the release_in_the_wild folder. We provide a meta file that records the speaker and label
corresponding to each wav file.

(3) Purpose:

① As the final external test set, measure the cross-domain performance of the model

② To test the false positive rate of final model under noise and compression distortion in social media/news clips;

## WaveFake

(1) Source: WaveFake: A Data Set to Facilitate Audio Deepfake Detection (Zenodo / GitHub), NeurIPS 2021 Datasets &
Benchmarks Track, SysSec Group, Ruhr University Bochum.

(2) Structure: 10 subsets, covering 7 TTS networks (WaveGlow, MelGAN, Parallel WaveGAN, etc.).
Each subset contains the corresponding fake audio (≈ 58 h) of the original LJSpeech (about 6 h) dataset, with a total
duration of > 60 h. The files here are all fraud samples, and are stored in the corresponding folders of their
respective generated models.

(3) Purpose:

① Backbone training set - provides multi-architecture synthetic samples to prevent the model from overfitting to a
single generator;

② Baseline data for frequency domain analysis experiments, supporting high-frequency difference visualization;

## Diffusion-based dataset

(1) Source: Diffuse or Confuse project of Brno University of Technology (arXiv 2024‑10).

(2) Structure: 14 sets of "pseudo-LJSpeech" are copied based on LJSpeech, and the synthesizers cover Grad‑TTS, DiffWave,
WaveGrad2, DiffGAN‑TTS, etc. A total of 183 400 fake recordings, of which 131 000 are generated by the diffusion model;
the total length is about 336 h. Each set is aligned 1‑to‑1 with LJSpeech, and CSV (path, synthesizer label, quality
indicators) and original transcription are provided. After import, data_source=diffusion-based, label=0 (fake),
synthetic_model=<name> for model interpretability research.

(3) Purpose:

① Evaluate the attack and defense threats of diffuse TTS to existing detectors

② Use it as incremental training data to improve the robustness of the model to the latest generation paradigm.

## voxceleb1

(1) Source: VoxCeleb large-scale speaker recognition dataset released by the Oxford VGG group (INTERSPEECH 2017, 2018;
download from the official website).
Robotics Science and Engineering

(2) Structure: VoxCeleb1: 1 251 celebrities, ≈ 153 k sentences, ≈ 352 h

The audio is a YouTube interview clip with a frame rate of 16 kHz. Projects are grouped in folders with speaker=<id>,
all with label=1.

(3) Purpose:

① Provide large-scale real speech priors for deep fake detection models for comparative learning/self-supervised
pre-training;

② Sampling real audio from noisy environments and across channels to improve the model's noise resistance.

## LJSpeech-1.1

(1) Source: Public domain English reading dataset released by Keith Ito & Linda Johnson (13,100 records, single female
voice).

(2) Structure: 44.1 kHz MP3 → resampled to 16 kHz WAV for this project; 1–10 s per record, total duration about 24 h.
Supporting metadata.csv (filename|text). In the internal CSV, data_source=ljspeech, speaker=LJ, label=1.

(3) Purpose:

① As a clean real person reference: one-to-one alignment with multiple fake versions (WaveFake, Diffusion‑TTS) during
training/evaluation;

② Generate the basis of synthetic speech to ensure that the real and fake content are completely matched, so that the
detector only focuses on acoustic artifacts;

# Data Split

### Overall scale and distribution

1 meta_final.csv contains 499,778 records, with fields including data_source | speaker | absolute_path | relative_path |
label | Set.

2 Divided by Set: train 368,780 (73.8%), test 111,589 (22.3%), in‑test 19,409 (3.9%).

3 Labels are defined as 1=bonafide (real), 0=spoof (fake); the true and false ratios of the three groups are similar (
train 37.9% real, test 35.2%, in‑test 37.8%), and the overall category is not unbalanced.

### Speaker Split

1 train contains 1,050 speakers and test contains 280 speakers, with no overlap (0/1,050).

2 in-test contains 1,029 speakers, of which 1,029 speakers appear in train and have no overlap with test.

3 Advantages: external evaluation (test) does not contain training speakers, which can effectively test cross-speaker
generalization.

### Generative Model Split

Non-diffusion model (classic TTS/GAN/Flow) partitioning strategy

1 Training set + in-test: 13 models appear at the same time, used to learn mainstream non-diffusion forgery features

2 Retain exclusive models for the test set:
(1) ljspeech_hifiGAN
(2) ljspeech_waveglow

These 2 models are completely absent in the training phase, and only 26 200 samples are given in the test to test the
extrapolation performance of the "unseen non-diffusion algorithm"

3 in-test only overlaps with the train model, and its role is to quickly debug and analyze false positives during
training, and does not participate in the final indicators

Diffusion model partitioning strategy

1 Training set + in-test: 6 diffusion models appear at the same time
• DiffGAN-TTS_naive • DiffGAN-TTS_shallow • ProDiff • tacotron2-DCA_diffwave • tacotron2-DCA_wavegrad • wavegrad2

2 Diffusion models exclusively for the test set:
(1) DiffGAN-TTS_aux(2) Grad-TTS(3) NATSpeech_DiffSpeech
39,300 samples in total, specifically to examine the generalization ability of the detector to "unseen diffusion
families"

## Reproduction Instructions
